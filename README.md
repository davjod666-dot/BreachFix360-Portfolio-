🛡️ BreachFix360 Cybersecurity Portfolio

Analyst: D. Seabrook
Location: NSW, Australia
Focus Areas: SOC Analysis • DFIR • Network Defence • Incident Response • System Forensics
Approach: Evidence-Driven • Log-First Learning • No Fluff

🔍 About Me

I’m an up-and-coming SOC/DFIR analyst who takes a hands-on, investigation-first approach to learning.
Instead of spending months stuck in theory, I immerse myself directly in:

Real logs

Real artefacts

Real anomalies

Real incidents

The quickest way to become effective in blue team work is to touch the data, break things, fix things, and study systems under real conditions. This portfolio reflects exactly that — a grounded, practical progression into cybersecurity built on forensic evidence, problem-solving, and log correlation, not guesswork.

I’m fresh, but I’m serious about this path — and this repo is the proof.

📦 What You’ll Find Here

This repository contains a curated collection of my cybersecurity work, including:

iOS/macOS system log analysis

Network forensics & baseline deviation detection

Router and NAT traversal investigations

Wireless protocol anomalies (AWDL, STUN, mDNS, FlowSwitch)

Device state forensics (RunningBoard, Skywalk, NetworkExtension)

UI deception vs backend behaviour analysis

Repeatable SOC-ready case studies

Evidence-based incident writeups

All content has been cleaned, standardised, and structured for readability and recruiter evaluation.

Incident triage and evidence grouping

Mapping UI behaviour vs backend events

Identifying false positives vs genuine indicators

📡 Network & Protocol Analysis

Wireshark, tcpdump, pcaps, router logs

NAT traversal, STUN/mDNS behaviour

P2P interface behaviour (AWDL)

Hidden tunnel & flow control anomalies (FlowSwitch/Skywalk)

📱 Mobile & System Forensics

iOS/macOS artefact analysis

RunningBoard state correlation

NetworkExtension / NECP evaluation

Device state, process state, and event correlation

🧰 Technical Habits & Methods

Structured case documentation

⭐ Highlights

Eight fully documented system-log case studies covering device behaviour, backend anomalies, and telemetry analysis.

Multiple network investigations demonstrating protocol interpretation and root-cause analysis.

Standardised SOC-ready format used across all case files.

Demonstrated ability to analyse real-world artefacts, identify deviations from expected behaviour, and articulate findings clearly.

Built from scratch with hands-on exploration instead of relying solely on coursework.
