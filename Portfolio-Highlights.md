Overview

This portfolio showcases a collection of real-world investigations I have performed across network security, system forensics, and mobile/endpoint analysis.
Each case demonstrates evidence-based methodology, structured analysis, and practical defensive application.

My focus areas:
	•	Incident response & digital forensics
	•	Network anomaly investigation
	•	System log analysis
	•	Home-network compromise assessment
	•	OS-level artefact interpretation
	•	Threat-hunting workflows
	•	SOC-aligned triage and reporting

Tools, Skills & Methods Highlighted

Technical Areas
	•	Network forensics (Wireshark, tcpdump, router logs)
	•	Endpoint forensics (macOS/iOS artefacts)
	•	Process analysis (RunningBoard, Transparency logs, taskinfo)
	•	Log correlation and timeline reconstruction
	•	Wireless behaviours (AWDL, STUN, multicast, QoS)

Why This Portfolio Matters

This collection demonstrates real hands-on experience — not lab simulations.
Each case is structured like an analyst report, showing:
	•	You recognise abnormal behaviours
	•	You gather and preserve evidence
	•	You test assumptions against data
	•	You write clearly and professionally
	•	You can operate in a SOC or blue-team environment today
