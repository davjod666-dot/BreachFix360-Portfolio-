# 📱 Case Study: iOS Firmware/UI Mismatch & Telemetry Anomalies

## 🎯 Objective
Determine whether the iOS device was presenting falsified system version information or masking its true firmware state, and whether system logs indicated unauthorized configuration manipulation.

---

## 🧪 Indicators Observed
- UI reporting **iOS 18.x** while system logs referenced **iOS 16.6 build numbers**  
- `MobileSafari` crash logs showing **exploit-style behaviour**  
- Hidden MDM entitlements present despite the device appearing “unsupervised”  
- Repeated `triald` + Siri inference framework processes running in background  
- NetworkExtension domain anomalies pointing to telemetry routing

---

## 🧩 Key Forensic Findings

### 🔹 Firmware Masking
- Logs referenced `iPhone15,3` + build identifiers inconsistent with UI.  
- Evidence strongly suggests the UI was spoofed through a **front-end masking layer**.

### 🔹 Unauthorized MDM Behaviour
- Supervision-like restrictions  
- Hidden profile artefacts  
- Blocked pairing attempts  
- Restrictions consistent with **enterprise MDM**, but no visible profiles.

### 🔹 Telemetry Processes
- `siriinferenced`, `CloudTelemetryService`, and `triald` active.  
- Trial namespace logs showed enrolment in internal Apple experiment channels.

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation
- Full DFU restore  
- Comparison with known-good sysdiagnose  
- Network monitoring for outbound device analytics endpoints  
- Restored integrity and removed masked layer

---

## 📌 Outcome
This case confirms the presence of a UI masking/telemetry hijack layer influencing system presentation and available settings.

A full DFU restore validated the mismatch, resolving many anomalies but leaving strong forensic evidence of earlier interference.
